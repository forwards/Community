The proposal is still very fluid, and feel free to offer alternative suggestions

#### Audience

* The intended audience is Career Young Statisticians and Data Scientists.
* RSVP instructions to follow the "Coding Grace" approach in Dublin: only a female can RSVP, but she can 
bring a male guest. 
* The female RSVP must be present for the Male guest to be allowed in.

#### Instructors
 - In the long term, female mentors and instructors.
 - Until enough come forward, a few male mentors too 
	( I do it all the time for Coding Grace - hence my connection )
 - we are building up a workshop github : RWorkshop.github.io


#### The Workshop comprises
1. Quick Introduction to R (1.5 hours)
2. dplyr (2 hours - and really nail it down really well)
3. ggplot (1 Hour - get the hang of the syntax)

To allow for exercise time, one to one questions and mentoring, give ourselves 6 hours to get throught it.

#### The Venue
 - at least some access to WiFi
 - Lots of Plugs
 - near somewhere to get food and coffee
 - good transports links and/or parking
 - Open on a Saturday from 10-5pm

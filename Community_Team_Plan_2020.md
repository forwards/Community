(Draft / Work in Progress)

### 1. Evolution of the Forwards Community Team into Region based teams.

Should we progessively work towards a demerger of the Community team into three (or more) regional teams?

One for each of the following regions (more or less dictacted by timezones)
 - Asia Pacific
 - Europe Middle East and Asia
 - Americas (North America & Latin America)

At the end of the transition process, there would be three (or more) free-standing teams.
Each team would have its own leads.

Down the line, these teams could probably demerge further, or full competencies be handed over
to regional organizations (Africa R for example).

### 2. Creation of an Operational Support Team

In addition to regionally organized community teams, I propose another sub-team that co-ordinates
operational support (technical knowledge, website, project development, event management, Sponsorship, high level contact with outside organizations).

The team would not be externally focussed (i.e. public facing). Instead it would act as a resource to the regional teams, as well as other Forwards teams.


### 3. Greater co-ordination with Social Media Team for Virtual Events

The community team will coordinate more with the social media team - particularly for virtual events.

It is probable that there will be more and more virtual events over the next three or four years - with some 
tech communities planning to retain virtual events after the Covid Crisis is over.

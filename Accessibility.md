### Accessibility to R Conferences and Events for Community Members with Disabilities

[UPDATE] The issue of accessibility for conferences for attendees with visual impairments post UseR! 2021 Conference via Slack continues to be pushed forward. It has become known that PDF files are not as accessible for text reading software as compared to HTML or Markdown files. Subtitles for YouTube videos are still a work in progress issue, as this is key for people with **hearing impairments**, as well as direct microphone usage {speaking directly into a microphone via earphones/ earbuds/ microphone plug-in} as to improve sound quality. 



### Accessibility to R Conferences and Events for Community Members with Visual Impairments 
The issue of accessibility for conferences for prospective attendees for visual impairments was raised on social media, in the wake of UseR! 2019.

The fact that conferences functionally exclude the visually impaired through lack of adequate accessibility, and consequently their perspectives were not accounted for in post-conference surveys was highlighted.

A task for the coming year, in anticipation of conferences in 2020, would be to work with conference organizers to devise action plans to make the conferences more accessible.

# Diversity Hire


Purpose: "resources for managers in industry who are trying to hire diverse data science / R talent."

Goal:  Could collate resources, or potentially create job board.

Ideas: 

- webscrape known data science job boards
- use LinkedIn pages
- use YouTube channels to spread the word 
- Discord channels
- Slacks 
    
Recommendation: it would be nice to have a "how to pass the interview at company X" being advertised

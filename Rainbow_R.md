#### Supporting Rainbow R events at Conferences 

The topic is to assist Rainbow R in the planning of social events at forthcoming R conferences.
The format can follow the format used for UseR! 2019.

* We can contact the organizers of WhyR? UseR! 2020, RstudioConf and ask that arrangements be facilitated (i.e. meeting room provided)
* For smaller events, it would be presumably easier to make arrangements on the Rainbow R slack.

(*Correctly, this is outside of the scope of the Forwards Taskforce. However the main organizer is happy for us to prepare projects and initiatives for Rainbow R*)

* This needs more support and more advertising, as there is low engagement and awareness. (personal opinion, based on observation and lack of Tweets from the Twitter account)

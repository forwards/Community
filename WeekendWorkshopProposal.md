Women In R Weekend Workshops
================================

Proposal: Run a series of 2 day weekend workshops in various cities

#### Lesson Plan
Each day of the workshop will have a self-contained lesson plan. If you miss one day, you dont have to catch up on anything for the other.

- ***Lesson Plan 1:*** Fundamentals , dplyr, ggplot2, magrittr
- ***Lesson Plan 2:*** Fundementals , statistics with R, dates and times, Character Data.

Other Lesson plans will be added on an ongoing basis.
Instruction will be carried out in English to begin with.


#### Joining Instructions

- The Coding Grace Project in Dublin, Ireland, runs *Female Friendly* coding workshops. For these workshops, only females may register, but they may bring a male guest. There has been several occasions there was a male majority in the session (Approx 60%).
To counter this, a policy of require the register attendee to be present, before guests will be admitted, has been proposed.

#### Code of Conduct
- A standing Code of Conduct shall be compiled. 

#### Organizers

- The Workshops will be facilitated by local users groups in conjunction with the Women in R taskforce.
   - Dublin R, Edinburgh R  
- The WiR Taskforce will actively recruited instructors and mentors (mainly but not exclusively female).
- Events may be run simultaneously with other related events (i.e. a PyData Event) to mitigate costs.  

#### Costs and Payments
 - There will be no charge (or minimal charge) for the workshops. (Minimal Charge to dissuade "no shows")
 - Mentoring and Instruction will be done on a voluntary basis.

#### Possible Locations
London - (R Ladies Coding Club London already in existence. They could provide mentors)

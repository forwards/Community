# Community Plan 2020

#### *Draft*


### Grant Proposals

Advise and assist conferences to make grant proposals to relevant charitable foundation, e,g, the Sloan Foundation, for the travel bursaries specifically for African and Asian R users.

The knowledge base can be retained for future conferences such as UseR! 2021.

### Accessibility to R Conferences and Events for Community Members with Visual Impairments 

The issue of accessibility for conferences for prospective attendees for visual impairments was raised on social media, in the wake of UseR! 2019.

The fact that conferences functionally exclude the visually impaired through lack of adequate accessibility, and consequently their perspectives were not accounted for in post-conference surveys was highlighted.

A task for the coming year, in anticipation of conferences in 2020, would be to work with conference organizers to devise action plans to make the conferences more accessible.

#### Forwards 
This was covered in these issues:

*    update survey: forwards/tasks#51
*    update event best practices: forwards/tasks#50


### Rainbow R 

#### Supporting Rainbow R events at Conferences 

The topic is to assist Rainbow R in the planning of social events at forthcoming R conferences.
The format can follow the format used for UseR! 2019.

* We can contact the organizers of eRum, UseR! 2020 and potentially, RstudioConf
* For smaller events, it would be presumably easier to make arrangements on the Rainbow R slack.

(*Correctly, this is outside of the scope of the Forwards Taskforce. However the main organizer is happy for us to prepare projects and initiatives for Rainbow R*)

### Facilitation of Remote Contribution

At the Forwards Community team meeting in August 2019, we discussed ideas to facilitate contribution of work from community members in remote locations.

(Here : "remote" can include a situation where a community member does not have opportunity to attend an R event, even if it is closeby.)

These contributions can be

*    contributions to a body of knowledge for the effective management of R community events and conferences.
*    contributions to software and documentation (i.e. Pull Requests).

There are events to facilitate community members to make their first contribution to R packages. However, due to the fact that these events are co-located at conferences, it means that only community members who can take part are those who have the means to attend the conference.
My First Pull Request

The Julia Community have a very informal, but effective, way of encouraging new contributors, with a " My First PR" section in their slack. This is the inspiration behind the idea, but the R community would not be able to facilitate the scheme the same way.

#### Approach

*    Creation of a bespoke GitHub repositiory on the Forwards GitHub account.
*    Facilitators will post potential pull requests (PR) as issues (i.e. if they spot a spelling mistake)
*    First time contributors are encouraged to visit the issues page, and attempt to close the issue.
*    Facilitators assists them by discussing what to do on the issues page.
*    Contributors complete the PR. The intention is that they are acknowledged as contributors on the CRAN documentation.
*    Furthermore successful completion of this task creates a stronger connection between the contributor to the package development process, and they seek more involved roles in future.

# Community Plan 2020

### *Draft*


## Grant Proposals

Advise and assist conferences to make grant proposals to relevant charitable foundation, e,g, the Sloan Foundation, for the travel bursaries specifically for African and Asian R users.

The knowledge base can be retained for future conferences such as UseR! 2021.

## Accessibility to R Conferences and Events for Community Members with Visual Impairments 

The issue of accessibility for conferences for prospective attendees for visual impairments was raised on social media, in the wake of UseR! 2019.

The fact that conferences functionally exclude the visually impaired through lack of adequate accessibility, and consequently their perspectives were not accounted for in post-conference surveys was highlighted.

A task for the coming year, in anticipation of conferences in 2020, would be to work with conference organizers to devise action plans to make the conferences more accessible.

#### Forwards 
This was covered in these issues:

*    update survey: forwards/tasks#51
*    update event best practices: forwards/tasks#50


## Rainbow R 

#### Supporting Rainbow R events at Conferences 

The topic is to assist Rainbow R in the planning of social events at forthcoming R conferences.
The format can follow the format used for UseR! 2019.

* We can contact the organizers of eRum, UseR! 2020 and potentially, RstudioConf
* For smaller events, it would be presumably easier to make arrangements on the Rainbow R slack.

(*Correctly, this is outside of the scope of the Forwards Taskforce. However the main organizer is happy for us to prepare projects and initiatives for Rainbow R*)
